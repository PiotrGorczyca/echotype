echo "1. First hotkey press starts recording"
echo "2. Second hotkey press stops recording and starts transcription"

echo "2. Press Ctrl+Shift+S ‚Üí Should see: 'üî¥ Recording started!'"
echo "3. Speak your message"
echo "4. Press Ctrl+Shift+S ‚Üí Should see: 'Hotkey detected! Stopping recording...'"
echo "5. During transcription ‚Üí Additional hotkey presses should show: 'DEBUG: Hotkey ignored (processing transcription)'"
echo "6. After transcription ‚Üí Should see: 'Ready for next recording.'"
echo "7. Can start new recording cycle"

echo "üîç What to verify:"
echo "‚úÖ NO duplicate 'Recording started!' messages after pressing hotkey to stop"
echo "‚úÖ Clear state transitions and processing indicators"
echo "‚úÖ Hotkey presses ignored during transcription"
echo "‚úÖ Ready message when transcription completes"

echo "üö® Previous Problem (now fixed):"
echo "‚ùå Second hotkey press would start HTTP request AND start new recording"
echo "‚ùå No protection against hotkey spam during processing"
echo "‚ùå Race conditions in state management"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Current Solution:"
echo "‚úÖ Added is_processing flag to prevent new recordings during transcription"
echo "‚úÖ Clear state management with debug messages"
echo "‚úÖ Error handling that doesn't break the state machine"
echo "‚úÖ 'Ready for next recording' indicator"
echo ""

echo "To test manually:"
echo "1. Run: ./zig-out/bin/echotype"
echo "2. Try rapid hotkey presses - should be properly debounced"
echo "3. Start recording ‚Üí stop recording ‚Üí try pressing hotkey during transcription"
echo "4. Verify only appropriate actions happen at each stage"
